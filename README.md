### Howdy!
I'm Taylor, and I think working with data is fascinating and challenging. I've worked to develop products for years and have been inspired by challenges in small-medium size business. I taught myself to code to solve problems but eventually wanted to upskill in a structured, immersive and challenging way. Was accepted to the Flatiron School in early 2021. On track to complete a Data Science certificate 10/2021!
