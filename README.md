### Howdy!
I'm Taylor, and I think working with data is fascinating and challenging. I've worked to develop products for manufacturing for years and have been inspired by challenges in medium-large businesses. I taught myself to code to automate administrative-type work and the Adobe Creative Suite. I started learning about Python + data when every Google answer to what I wanted to do with an Excel macro was "use Python." Eventually I wanted to upskill in a structured, immersive and challenging way. I was accepted to the Flatiron School in early 2021, and completed the program successfully 10/2021. I'm on the hunt for a full-time position!
